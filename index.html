                        ‘Money money money, must be funny in a rich man’s world’ is the lyrics to ABBA’s famous song.
                        How much money is fun though? Research show that, on a global level, individuals with an annual
                        income of between $60,000 - $75,000 are likely to reach satiation of emotional well-being. An
                        income of $95,000 will likely make you feel satiation on life evaluation.

                        So if money really can buy happiness, is there a ceiling to how happy you can get for money?
                        Accodring to researchers: yes, there is. It turns out that as your annual income rise above
                        $95,000, the happiness curve tend to flatten out, or even fall. Meaning that making more money
                        could eventually steal your happiness from you. So a more accurate melody of ABBA’s hit would be
                        ‘Money money money, is only fun up to a certain threshold in an individuals world’

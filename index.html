                but it is safe to say that all humans have their emotional ups and downs. Sometimes we feel happy and
                sometimes we feel low, but have you ever wondered</p>

                        ‘Money money money, must be funny in a rich man’s world’ is the lyrics in ABBA’s famous song.
                        How much money is fun though? Research show that, on a global level, individuals with an annual
                        income of between $60,000 - $75,000 are likely to reach satiation of emotional well-being,
                        referring to the emotional quality of an individual’s everyday experience. An income of $95,000
                        will likely make you feel satiation on life evaluation, referring to the thoughts that people
                        have about their life when they think about it.
                        <br>
                        <br> So if money really can buy happiness,
            
                        <br> <span style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>is there a ceiling to how happy you can get for money?</strong> </span>
                        <br> According to researchers: <span style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 25px"> <strong>Yes, there is</strong> </span> - It turns out that as your annual income rise above
                        $95,000, the happiness curve tend to flatten out, or even fall. Meaning that making more money
                        could eventually steal your happiness from you. So a more accurate melody of ABBA’s hit would be
                        <br> ‘Money money money, is only fun up to a certain threshold in an individuals world’
                    </p>

                <h1 style="padding-left: 32px; margin-top: 50px;"> What can I do to increase my happiness? </h1>
                <div class="wrapper">
                    <div class="box1" style="padding-left: 32px; font-size: 16px;line-height: 25px;">So if I don’t have the possibility to neither raise my salary or leave the country
                        - is there anything else I, as an individual, can do in order to change my happily ever after
                        destiny?
                        <br> <br> Of course there is:
                        <br> <span style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>you can aim to work less!</strong> </span>
                        <br style="line-height: 25px"> As contradictory to the data presented above as it sounds, as working more most likely will
                        result in a larger income, which could contribute to a higher level of happiness, research also
                        show a correlation between decreased working load and increased happiness.
                        Not to surprising though, as working less naturally should give you more time for other
                        activities important for your well-being and happiness, such as spending time with family and
                        friends, which has also shown to increase happines.</div>

            <p style="text-align: center; padding: 0px 32px 0px 32px; font-style: italic;">These are the words of
                Aristotle, and his utterance holds even today. The value in happiness is global,
                but it is safe to say that all humans have their emotional ups and downs. Sometimes we feel happy and
                sometimes we feel low, but have you ever wondered</p>

                        investigated happiness across the globe annually
                        since 2012 and for the last two years Finland has been in the very top, followed by its
                        neighbors Denmark and Norway. Sweden hits the list on 7th place. So is it safe to say that my
                        happiness is dependent on where I live? The short answer is: <strong>yes, to some
                            extent.</strong> But there are

                        ‘Money money money, must be funny in a rich man’s world’ is the lyrics to ABBA’s famous song.
                        How much money is fun though? Research show that, on a global level, individuals with an annual
                        income of between $60,000 - $75,000 are likely to reach satiation of emotional well-being,
                        referring to the emotional quality of an individual’s everyday experience. An income of $95,000
                        will likely make you feel satiation on life evaluation, referring to the thoughts that people
                        have about their life when they think about it.

                        So if money really can buy happiness, is there a ceiling to how happy you can get for money?
                        Accodring to researchers: yes, there is. It turns out that as your annual income rise above
                        $95,000, the happiness curve tend to flatten out, or even fall. Meaning that making more money
                        could eventually steal your happiness from you. So a more accurate melody of ABBA’s hit would be
                        ‘Money money money, is only fun up to a certain threshold in an individuals world’

                <h1 style="padding-left: 32px;"> What can I do to increase my happiness? </h1>
                <div class="wrapper">
                    <div class="box1" style="padding-left: 32px; font-size: 16px;">So if I don’t have the possibility to neither raise my salary or leave the country
                        - is there anything else I, as an individual, can do in order to change my happily ever after
                        destiny?
                        Of course there is: You can
                        aim to work less!
                        As contradictory to the data presented above as it sounds, as working more most likely will
                        result in a larger income, which could contribute to a higher level of happiness, research also
                        show a correlation between decreased working load and increased happiness.
                        Not to surprising though, as working less naturally should give you more time for other
                        activities important for your well-being and happiness, such as spending time with family and
                        friends, which has also shown to increase happines.</div>
